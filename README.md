# Analysis of relationships between DNAm and lung function

EWAS performed by Mikeong Lee et al identified ~1200 DNAm - lung function sites. Task is to understand the causal relationships.

To run this analysis we need:

- `snp_1kg.rdata` from GoDMC analysis
- `EWAS_PFTs_FDRsignCpGs_450K_MKL.xlsx` from EWAS analysis

Then render the `analysis.Rmd` RMarkdown notebook.
